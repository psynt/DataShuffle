SoftwareCide-Squad's solution for data visualisation

We don't have a release yet, so most of our work is on the Development (dev) branch.

Our project is nicely structured with the /src/main folder containing source files
 packaged nicely according to purpose.
The 3 main components of the project each have their own package (webscraper, application and saver) 
and work being completed by different parts of the team.

Spock unit tests have been written for many of the web scraper tests.

Links to the documentation can be found in the Project wiki

1.Our main Trello board contains major discussion and information about the project, such
 as task breakdowns and work allocation.
 
2.Minutes are included for each of our 2 weekly whole team meetings, with notes on what
 was discussed and what is to be completed in the coming development week. 
 
3.A link can also be found to our google drive folder, where our main documentation PDF can
 be found along with resources such as our initial gantt chart and other diagrams.
